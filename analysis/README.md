# Analysis and development notebooks

This subdirectory contains all of the notebooks used for prototyping and analysis in this project. Analysis are organazed into subdirs labeled as follows:

`{SG, RC, RT, NF}[00-99]__description`

Such that it's clear who made the directory and what they were doing. 

Update (8/10/23): As the project has evolved, many individual notebooks my have fallen out of sync with the rest of the package. We will be populating a separate tutorials directory over the coming months.
