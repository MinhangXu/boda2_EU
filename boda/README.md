# BODA

Source code for the core BODA library is seperated into 4 submodules:

1. boda.data - Specifies the data upon which a model is built
2. boda.model - Specifies the predictive model associated with the underlying data
3. boda.graph - Specifies computation graphs on top of predictive models (e.g., for training and inference)
4. boda.generator - Specifies methods for generating sequences
